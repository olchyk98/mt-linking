Live reload watches your source package and repeats the linking process whenever files change. Use it while developing so the consumer project always reflects the latest code.

## What the watcher does

- Monitors the source folder for file changes.
- Skips paths listed in `.gitignore` to reduce noise.
- Waits for a short debounce window before firing another build.

## How jobs are queued

1. Each change schedules a new link, but Oink runs one job at a time.
2. If another change arrives mid-run, Oink drops older pending work and keeps only the newest request.
3. Logs still appear in the terminal, and desktop notifications confirm the result.

## Debounce rules

- The default debounce is `200` milliseconds.
- Passing `--debounce <ms>` increases the delay. Values below `200` are clamped to keep the system stable.

<Aside type="caution">
  <p>Heavy builds? Start with <code>--debounce 500</code>. You can shorten the delay once rebuilds feel smooth.</p>
</Aside>

## Tips for smooth runs

- Pair <code>--livereload</code> with <code>--reprompt</code> only when you want Oink to restart after finishing a run.
- Ensure <code>git</code> is available. Without it, Oink cannot honour <code>.gitignore</code>, and every change triggers a rebuild.

## One-off linking

Skip <code>--livereload</code> when you only need a single link. Oink will run once and exit.
