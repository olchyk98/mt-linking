Oink keeps a simple registry of every package you have taught it. The registry lives at `~/.config/oink/link/` and is made of symlinks that point back to the real package folders on your machine.

## Folder layout

- Scoped packages create nested folders that mirror their scope, for example `~/.config/oink/link/@scope/pkg`.
- Each entry is a symlink named after the package.
- Peek into the folder any time to see which packages are ready to link.

## How entries are created

When you run `oink learn`, Oink:

1. Checks that the target contains a valid `package.json` with a name.
2. Creates any parent folders that do not yet exist.
3. Replaces an existing symlink so the registry always points to the latest path.

## How Oink uses the registry

- The main `oink` command filters the registry to show only packages that are both learned and installed in the current project.
- The registry also tells Oink exactly where to pull files from when it copies build output into a dependency.

</Aside>

## Keeping the registry healthy

- Use `oink forget` whenever symlinks go stale or packages move.
- On Windows or restricted environments, creating symlinks may require elevated permissions.
- If you adjust the folder manually, follow up with <code>oink learn</code> so Oink restores a clean symlink.
