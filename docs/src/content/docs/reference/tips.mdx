- Run `pnpm run lint`, `pnpm run typecheck`, and `pnpm run test` before publishing or sharing changes.
- Unsure which strategy applies? Write a short script that imports `getLinkingStrategyForPackage` and logs the result for your package path.
- Live reload slowing you down? Increase the debounce (for example `--debounce 500`). Values below `200` milliseconds are ignored.
- After editing the registry manually, run `oink forget` followed by `oink learn` to rebuild clean symlinks.
- Watch desktop notifications so you know whether a link succeeded without scrolling back through logs.
- Update this documentation whenever you add new behaviour or uncover a useful trick.
