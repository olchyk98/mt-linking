This quick tour gets you linking in minutes. Follow each step in order, and you will have a working setup ready for live reload by the end.

### 1. Install the CLI

```sh
pnpm install -g oink0
```

This places `oink` and `olink` on your PATH so you can call them from any project.

### 2. Teach Oink a package

Run inside the package you want to share:

```sh
oink learn
```

Oink creates a symlink in `~/.config/oink/link/` so it remembers this package. Repeat for every package you plan to link.

### 3. Link it into a consumer

Switch to the project that depends on your package and run:

```sh
oink
```

Choose the package from the `fzf` list, or pass its name directly. Oink builds the source and copies the results into every matching `node_modules` folder.

### 4. Keep the link fresh (optional)

```sh
oink --livereload
```

Live reload watches the source package for changes and repeats the build-and-copy cycle automatically.

  <p>Need more time between rebuilds? Add <code>{'--debounce 500'}</code> to wait half a second after each change before the next link runs.</p>
