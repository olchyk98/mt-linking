Oink ships on npm as `oink0` and exposes the `oink` and `olink` binaries. Choose the path that fits your workflow.

### Option A: Global install

```sh
pnpm install -g oink0
```

This mirrors the command in the public README and is the fastest way to use Oink across repositories. After installing, run `oink --help` to confirm the CLI is accessible.

### Option B: Run from source

1. Install dependencies:

   ```sh
   pnpm install
   ```

2. Bundle the CLI:

   ```sh
   pnpm run transpile
   ```

   This uses `esbuild` to bundle `index.ts` into `dist/` and normalises any `node:` protocol imports for broader Node support.

3. Launch the compiled CLI:

   ```sh
   node --enable-source-maps dist
   ```

Need a standalone executable? Run `pnpm run predeploy`, then `pnpm run deploy:local` to copy `dist/run.js` into `/usr/local/bin/oink` (requires sudo).

<Aside type="tip">
  <p>After installing, run <code>oink learn</code> inside a sample package and check for a new entry under <code>~/.config/oink/link/</code>. That confirms Oink can read and write its registry.</p>
