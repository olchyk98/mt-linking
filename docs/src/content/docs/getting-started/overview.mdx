Oink saves you from copying build artefacts by hand. Learn a package once, run `oink` in any project that depends on it, and Oink keeps the install in sync.

## Why Oink exists

- Sync source code straight into a consumer project without publishing.
- Support frontend bundles, amend-style services, and everything in between.
- Handle single-package repos and Yarn or PNPM workspaces with a single workflow.

<Aside type="tip">
  <p>Whenever you would otherwise copy files into <code>node_modules</code>, try Oink first--it does the heavy lifting and remembers your packages.</p>
</Aside>

## The core loop

1. **Learn** a package with `oink learn` so it appears in the registry.
2. **Link** from inside the consumer project with `oink`.
3. **Iterate** by adding <code>--livereload</code> for automatic rebuilds during development.

## When to use it

Reach for Oink when you:

- Need to test changes in one package against another without publishing.
- Share code across a workspace and want reliable updates.
- Prefer clear logs, notifications, and guardrails while linking.
